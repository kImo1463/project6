# E-Ticket Application

## Overview

This project is an e-ticket application designed to facilitate interactions between normal users and event managers. The platform provides a seamless experience for event managers to create and manage events, while normal users can easily browse available events, purchase tickets, and track their orders. By integrating comprehensive event management capabilities with user-friendly ticket purchasing options, the application aims to streamline event logistics and enhance user engagement.

## Why I Chose This Project

I chose this project to challenge myself with a more complex application that integrates both frontend and backend functionalities. I wanted to create a platform that not only handles user interactions but also manages event logistics, providing a practical solution for real-world scenarios. This project allowed me to explore new areas of web development, such as role-based access control and dynamic content management.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness

The e-ticket application stands out through its multi-role functionality and comprehensive feature set:

- **Multi-Role Functionality**: The application caters to both event managers and normal users, offering tailored experiences for each role. Event managers can create and manage events, while users can browse, purchase, and track tickets.

- **Integrated Features**: Beyond basic CRUD operations, this platform includes event creation, ticket management, and user order processing within a single solution. This integration offers a seamless experience that enhances user engagement and satisfaction.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: The application ensures secure and appropriate access through differentiated permissions for users and event managers, protecting sensitive data and actions.

### Complexity

The application incorporates several complex features and architectural decisions:

- **Advanced API Design**: Complex API endpoints facilitate efficient communication between the frontend and backend, with robust data serialization and endpoint security.

- **Intricate Backend Logic**: The backend manages user roles, permissions, and order processing with dynamic assignment and reliable transaction handling.

- **Dynamic Frontend-Backend Interaction**: Real-time updates ensure that changes in data are reflected immediately, enhancing user experience with responsive design across devices.

### Challenges and Solutions

Developing this application involved overcoming several challenges:

- **API Communication**: Ensuring efficient and secure data flow between the frontend and backend was crucial.
  
- **Role Management**: Implementing a clear separation of responsibilities and secure access control required careful planning and execution.
  
- **Scalability**: Designing the application to handle increasing numbers of users and events without performance issues was essential.

These challenges pushed me to deepen my understanding of Django, API design, and scalable architecture, resulting in a robust and user-friendly application.

## File Descriptions

- **urls.py**: The main entry point of the project, responsible for routing.
- **events**: The core application directory, containing:
  - **static/**: JavaScript files for handling API calls:
    - `event_manager_dashboard.js`: For managing events and tickets.
    - `user_dashboard.js`: For retrieving events and processing orders.
  - **templates/**: HTML templates for the application:
    - `register.html`: User registration page.
    - `login.html`: User login page.
    - `base.html`: Basic layout template.
    - `user_dashboard.html`: Displays the user dashboard.
    - `event_manager_dashboard.html`: Displays the event manager page.
  - **serializers.py**: Facilitates API communication.
  - **urls.py**: The main entry point of the application, responsible for routing.
  - **models.py**: Defines the application's data structure.
  - **views.py**: Contains logic to interact with models.
  - **admin.py**: Registers models for the Django admin interface.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run migrations using `python manage.py migrate`.
3. Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

This setup is similar to other Django applications and does not require special configurations.

### Future Improvements

I plan to integrate a real payment system to enhance the application's functionality. Additionally, I aim to add features based on user feedback and emerging needs. This will ensure the application remains relevant and useful for its intended audience.
